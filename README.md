# Multivariate Data Analysis

This repository contains the implementations of the lab assignments done for the MSc Course *Multivariate Data Analysis* at TU Delft. All the algorithms are implemented from scratch.

## 1st Assignment

The first lab assignment contains the implementation of the simple **online linear regression** algorithm where mean and covaraince of the posterior are updated with every new data sample..

## 2nd Assignment

The second lab assignment contains the implementation of different algorithms for computing the posterior when closed-form solution isn't possible: **Laplace approximation**, **Markov Chain Monte Carlo**, **Gibb's Sampling**.

## 3rd Assignment

The third lab assignment contais some example realisations of Gaussian Processes with different kernels and the algorithm for **Gaussian Process classification using Gibb's Sampling**.
